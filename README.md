## Summary:
We propose a novel MV-FCM clustering algorithm with an unsupervised learning framework, called the unsupervised MV-FCM (U-MV-FCM), such that it can search an optimal number of clusters during the iteration process of the algorithm without giving the number of clusters a priori. It is also free of initializations and parameter selection. We then use three synthetic and six benchmark datasets to make comparisons between the proposed U- MV-FCM and other existing algorithms and to highlight its practical implications.
